## Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

 - Subject: subject ID (integer).
 - Activity: the string activity name:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING

## Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
